<h1>Hi, my name is Sanvi! My favourite and most used hobby is Music. Everybody listens to Music, and there are many famous Musicians around the world. My favourite Musician is Beethoven and my favourite band is the One Voice Childrens Choir. I love Music because it's fun to play and it's very soothing, especially when you are in a bad mood. The picture below shows the One Voice Childrens Choir when they performed Believer.</h1>

<h1>My work is about my second most favourite hobby. My second most favourite hobby is Skating. I started it, I think at the beginning of last year, and I have become very good at it...but still not an Advanced Skater. The image below shows a video of Skating. I am sorry that this video had to be a tutorial but it is just Roller Hockey and there is mostly just Ice Skating.</h1>

<h1>Inspiration:</h1>
<br>
<h1>My inspiration is about the Musician and Band that I love the most! My favourite Musician is Beethoven, because even though he was actually deaf he created lovely pieces of Music. My favourite Band is the One Voice Childrens Choir, because they sing so well and have amazing voices!</h1>
